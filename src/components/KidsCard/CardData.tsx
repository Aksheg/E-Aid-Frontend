        <strong>Ensure safety:</strong>Remove the child from any immediate
        danger and keep them still.
        <br /> <br /> <strong>Assess consciousness:</strong> Check if the child
        is responsive. If they are unconscious, call for emergency medical
        assistance immediately. <br /> <br />
        <strong>Apply pressure:</strong> If there is bleeding, cover the wound
        with a clean cloth and apply gentle pressure to control the bleeding.
        <br /> <br />
        <strong>Ice pack:</strong> If there is swelling, apply an ice pack
        wrapped in a cloth to the affected area for 10-15 minutes at a time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Seek medical attention:</strong> Even if the injury seems minor,
        it's crucial to have a healthcare professional evaluate the child to
        rule out any internal or long-term damage.

    tips: (
      <span>
        <strong>Administer epinephrine auto-injector:</strong> If the child has
        been prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen), use it
        immediately by following the instructions provided. Call emergency
        services right away. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Stay calm and reassure the child:</strong> Anxiety can
        worsen symptoms, so provide comfort and reassurance while waiting for
        medical assistance. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Keep the child lying down:</strong> Help them lie flat on
        their back with their legs elevated, unless they are vomiting or having
        difficulty breathing. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Monitor vital signs:</strong> Check the child's
        breathing, pulse, and level of consciousness until medical help arrives.{" "}
        <br />
        <br /> <strong>Avoid allergens:</strong> Identify and remove the trigger
        if possible. If the child has known allergies, make sure to inform
        medical professionals.

    heading: "Nosebleed",
    tips: (
      <span>
        <strong>Stay calm:</strong> Reassure the child that nosebleeds are
        common and usually not serious. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Sit upright:</strong> Have the child sit down and lean
        slightly forward to prevent blood from flowing down the back of their
        throat. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Pinch the nostrils:</strong> Using the thumb and index
        finger, gently pinch the soft part of the nose together just below the
        bony bridge. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Maintain pressure:</strong> Maintain pressure for 10-15
        minutes without releasing it. Encourage the child to breathe through
        their mouth during this time. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Apply cold compress:</strong> Place a cold cloth or ice
        pack on the child's forehead or back of the neck to help constrict blood
        vessels and reduce bleeding. <br />
        <br /> <strong>Seek medical help:</strong> If the bleeding doesn't stop
        after 15 minutes of consistent pressure or if it's a recurring
        nosebleed, seek medical assistance.
